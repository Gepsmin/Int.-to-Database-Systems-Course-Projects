# DB Design

This project aims to create the pseudo instructions to create and manipulate a storage management system.

## Pseudo Usage

To run the code given, first of all your system needs to have python. After that, be sure that you have project.py and SystemCatalogue.txt in your system.

You can run the code with two different options. First you can open the code with some IDE and edit the configurations as follows: 

```
operationName argumants(in ordered and space between them)
```

**Example usage:**
```
listAllRecords Student
createType Student id age department gpa 
```

Secondly you can use terminal. Go to the directory that stores the project.py and SystemCatalogue.txt. Then type:

```
py project.py operationName argumants(in ordered and space between them)
```

**Example usage:**
```
py project.py listAllRecords Student
py project.py createType Student id age department gpa
```
